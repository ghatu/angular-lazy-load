# angular-lazy-load
Angular2 lazy loading with modular approach. 

What are Modules in angular2?

Modules are group of related pieces of code and are bunched together. They are available on demand.

Why modular approach?

This will decrease the initial loading time of an application and increase performance. Modules that are lazily loaded will only be loaded when the user navigates to their routes.
